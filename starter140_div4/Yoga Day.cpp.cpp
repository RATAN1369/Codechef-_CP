//this is quiet simple you just need to find the number of surya namasker chef can complete 
// in one surya namaskar there are 12 poses 
// you are given the number of poses which is equal to n
// so if you divide n by 12 you will get the number of surya namasker he can complete during the session 
//for example->
// n=48 -> 12 12 12 12 he can do 4 surya namsakar which is equal to saying 48/12
//n=13-> 12 1 he can do only 1 surya namaskar which is equal to saying 13/12
